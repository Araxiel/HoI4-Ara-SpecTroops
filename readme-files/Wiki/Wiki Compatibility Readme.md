This is an ever-expanding list of mods that are indeed compatible with this or work well with it.

These mods work fine together.

## Semi-Compatible Mods
These mods work together, but there might be tiny conflicts (which you might not even notice as a player) or they are very likely to conflict in the near-future because of updates of this or the other mod.

* [Kaiserreich](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=809903394)[There are some incompatibilities between the two mods; nothing game-breaking, but various small issues can and will appear. In other words; not advised, but possible]
* [Araxiel's Signal Company Buff](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=780512660)
* Realistic Air Missions (LITE)
* Expanded Engineering [technically compatible, but logically makes no sense; a lot of technologies are overlapping, such as proximity fuses or computer-assisted targeting; having both on most likely result in a really poor and really unbalanced experience]
* Vanilla+ [Overwrites the Vanilla+ tech-tree, but otherwise works]

## Non-Compatible Mods
These mods are incompatible and will cause either this mod or the other mod to break or at the very least, be overwritten.

*  Araxiel's Arty Upgrades for SPs
*  Road to '56
*  Tech Tree Expansion
*  Millenium Dawn
*  Timeline of Iron
*  Realistic Air Missions v3.3
*  Black Ice
*  Expert AI 2.0
