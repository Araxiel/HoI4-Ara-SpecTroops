[i]"What does Sanguinem et Lacrimis even mean?"[/i]
Sanguinem et Lacrimis means [i]Blood and Tears[/i]. The working title when I started this in January was "specialised troops". Since the mod became much more than just specialised troops, I decided to rename it to "Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat" based on Winston Churchill's quote. But that was too much of a mouth-full, so I trimmed it down to "Blood and Tears" and translated it into Latin because why the hell not.
[i]"Why did it take so long to make this mod? You said in January "coming soon", this is nearly three months later..."[/i]
Yeah well, I had a very busy start of the year. And once march hit I was too busy [url=https://twitter.com/Araxiel/status/837863068520615936]hunting mecha dinosaurs[/url].
[i]"You announced mod XY a long time ago! Where is it?! I want it now! Why are you not giving it to me!"[/i]
See the previous point. Also...making a good mod by myself takes time. I want shit to work, I want to have proper research done and well written descriptions rooted in reality and history. But mostly I simply don't have enough time to create finished and polished mods. And finished and polished mods is the only thing I want to publish. I despise completely broken, unfinished, early access, pre-alpha mods, that barely work, have place-holder images and place-holder text everywhere and break the game. You only get one release; you should better make it good.
So yeah; those other mods will come out when the clock strikes [url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time]Valve Time[/url].
