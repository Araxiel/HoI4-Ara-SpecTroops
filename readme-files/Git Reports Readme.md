If you're reporting an issue you're encountering, try to include as many details as possible about what you were doing when the bug occurred; a detailed report makes a bug much easier to track down.<br>
The more helpful you are, the easier it to solve the problem; the easier it is, the faster the problem is solved.

If you have the error log, either include it directly here, or upload it to [Pastebin<img src="https://www.shareicon.net/data/128x128/2015/09/30/109424_binary_24x24.png" alt="exclamation_mark" width="18"/>][4].

If you are suspecting any conflicts, include what other mods you had running.

Requests are not necesarilly bugs, but conflicts that could require fixing or requests for compatibility with another mod. Or it could be a request to look into improving something, or maybe a request to change the balance of something.<br>Basically everything that's not broken, but wouldn't mind a fixing.<br>Similar guidelines such as with bugs apply here; the more precise you are the easier it is to look into it.

Suggestions are exactly that; an idea of what should be added to this mod. Pretty much anything goes, but use common sense of course. Remember the actual or potential scope of this mod.
