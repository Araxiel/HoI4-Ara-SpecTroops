This mod greatly alters most of the technologies without straying too far from vanilla, for extra immersion, realism and historical accuracy.

From amphibious tanks, to commandeering civilian vehicles all the way to chemical warfare.

[*] Adds tons of research to the artillery folder; from railway guns, like the unused US M1920, to early SAM, such as the German Rheintochter, and early ATGMs, such as the French SS.10.
[*] Includes [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827398034]Araxiel's Arty Upgrades for SPs[/url].
[*] Expands the industry folder into the early 50s and adds various specific construction buffs.
[*] Amphibious tanks and APCs such as the American Sherman DD, the German Landwasserschlepper or the Japanese Type 2 Ka-Mi; historic equipment with images where applicable.
[*] Glider tanks, such as the Mk VII Tetrarch.
[*] Penal battalions and political commissar detachments for the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdOgvdbl314]Commulists[/url] and [url=https://twitter.com/prttybadtweeter/status/822620848897069056]Fascists[/url] amongst us.
[*] Chemical Warfare mechanics: unleash this deadly weapon in combat and force the enemy to react, but beware of the diplomatic consequences; once the genie is out of the bottle it can't be put back in.
[*] Desert and jungle equipment and winter training for the troops.
[*] Officer schools to improve your commanders.
[*] Civilian press manipulation for the home-front; strengthen your government against foreign subversive activities or requisition civilian vehicles for the front.
[*] Extensive research went into this to bring the most historically accurate experience, while still trying to maintain a balance and remain entertaining and familiar. From description to names, images and appropriate introductory years.

This mod greatly changes the technology folders. This means it's pretty much incompatible with any other mod that changes or adds technologies. Mods such as [i]The Road to 56[/i] do not work with this, and obvious mods like WW1 mods or [i]Millennium Dawn[/i] do not work with this either.
That said; most normal mods should work with this since they don't change technologies, that even includes [i]Kaiserreich[/i] for example.

There should be no bugs; this mod is 99% done and ready to play. There should be no broken icons or text.

[i]"What does Sanguinem et Lacrimis even mean?"[/i]
Sanguinem et Lacrimis means [i]Blood and Tears[/i]. The working title when I started this in January was "specialised troops". Since the mod became much more than just specialised troops, I decided to rename it to "Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat" based on Winston Churchill's quote. But that was too much of a mouth-full, so I trimmed it down to "Blood and Tears" and translated it into Latin because why the hell not.
[i]"Why did it take so long to make this mod? You said in January "coming soon", this is nearly three months later..."[/i]
Yeah well, I had a very busy start of the year. And once march hit I was too busy [url=https://twitter.com/Araxiel/status/837863068520615936]hunting mecha dinosaurs[/url].
[i]"You announced mod XY a long time ago! Where is it?! I want it now! Why are you not giving it to me!"[/i]
See the previous point. Also...making a good mod by myself takes time. I want shit to work, I want to have proper research done and well written descriptions rooted in reality and history. But mostly I simply don't have enough time to create finished and polished mods. And finished and polished mods is the only thing I want to publish. I despise completely broken, unfinished, early access, pre-alpha mods, that barely work, have place-holder images and place-holder text everywhere and break the game. You only get one release; you should better make it good.
So yeah; those other mods will come out when the clock strikes [url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time]Valve Time[/url].
