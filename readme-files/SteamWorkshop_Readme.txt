This mod greatly alters most of the technologies without straying too far from vanilla, for extra immersion, realism and historical accuracy.

From amphibious tanks, to commandeering civilian vehicles all the way to unleash chemical warfare.

I felt that certain types of units and tactics were missing; units and equipment that can open up interesting options and that historically were used to great success or that failed to live up to it's potential. Additionally I felt that the game becomes stale and an absolute slog after around the '43 mark. For some reason, Most tech-folders simply stop; I feel this problem is most pronounced in the industry folder where after 45 your industrial capacity simply stops, usually causing an awkward scramble for very basic things like steel, or the lack of improvements for ship construction.

But I also wanted to make things more interesting than simply adding five [i]+10% soft attack[/i] technologies; thus many new technologies either add completely new types of effects and units or shift things around.

WHAT THIS MOD DOES
[list=1]
[*] Adds tons of research to the artillery folder; from railway guns, like the unused US M1920, to early SAM, such as the German Rheintochter, and early ATGMs, such as the French SS.10.
[*] Includes [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827398034]Araxiel's Arty Upgrades for SPs[/url].
[*] Expands the industry folder into the early 50s and adds various specific construction buffs.
[*] Amphibious tanks and APCs such as the American Sherman DD, the German Landwasserschlepper or the Japanese Type 2 Ka-Mi; historic equipment with images where applicable.
[*] Glider tanks, such as the Mk VII Tetrarch.
[*] Penal battalions and political commissar detachments for the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdOgvdbl314]Commulists[/url] and [url=https://twitter.com/prttybadtweeter/status/822620848897069056]Fascists[/url] amongst us.
[*] Chemical Warfare mechanics: unleash this deadly weapon in combat and force the enemy to react, but beware of the diplomatic consequences; once the genie is out of the bottle it can't be put back in.
[*] Desert and jungle equipment and winter training for the troops.
[*] Officer schools to improve your commanders.
[*] Civilian press manipulation for the home-front; strengthen your government against foreign subversive activities or requisition civilian vehicles for the front.
[/list]

I tried to make it balanced by using stats similar to other tech in the game. Is it actually balanced? I don't know but, I hope so. I did a SP playthrough with it and it seemed to be okay.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod greatly changes the technology folders. This means it's pretty much incompatible with any other mod that changes or adds technologies. Mods such as [i]The Road to 56[/i] do not work with this, and obvious mods like WW1 mods or [i]Millennium Dawn[/i] do not work with this either.
That said; most normal mods should work with this since they don't change technologies, that even includes [i]Kaiserreich[/i] for example.

[h1]Planned Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Secret Service: Special forces missions; from dynamically generated once such as assassinations and sabotage to historical missions such as Operation Paperclip...have encryption and decryption finally have a impact.
[*] Expand on existing S&L tech with more events.
[*] Expand on penal technology.
[*] Create more civilian bureaus
[*] Industrial events
[*] Add tank technologies into the 50s
[*] Add naval technologies into the 50s
[*] Expand on support companies
[*] Add infantry tech into the 50s
[*] Revamp electronics technologies folder
[*] Expand air technology into the 50s
