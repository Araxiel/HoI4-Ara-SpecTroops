This is an ever-expanding list of mods that are indeed compatible with this or work well with it.

[h1]Compatible Mods[/h1]
These mods work fine together.

[h1]Semi-Compatible Mods[/h1]
These mods work together, but there might be tiny conflicts (which you might not even notice as a player) or they are very likely to conflict in the near-future because of updates of this or the other mod.

[*] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=809903394]Kaiserreich[/url] [There are some incompatibilities between the two mods; nothing game-breaking, but various small issues can and will appear. In other words; not advised, but possible]
[*] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=780512660]Araxiel's Signal Company Buff[/url]
[*] Realistic Air Missions (LITE)
[*] Expanded Engineering [technically compatible, but logically makes no sense; a lot of technologies are overlapping, such as proximity fuses or computer-assisted targeting; having both on most likely result in a really poor and really unbalanced experience]
[*] Vanilla+ [Overwrites the Vanilla+ tech-tree, but otherwise works]
[*] Aldebaran [The completely different map will break prospecting, but the mod as a whole should still work okay]
[/list]

[h1]Non-Compatible Mods[/h1]
These mods are incompatible and will cause either this mod or the other mod to break or at the very least, be overwritten.
