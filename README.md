## What does this mod do?
It adds various types of new units and equipment to the game and expands researchable tech into the late-game years.  
A complete list of changes and new tech-trees can be found in the wiki.

## When will it be released?
Probably around mid February. I greatly expanded the scope of this mod, which meant much more work.

## Where can you download this mod?
This mod can exclusively be found on the Steam Workshop. If this mod is found anywhere else (unless specified otherwise by myself), it's an illegitimate and unauthorized re-upload.

## How can I contribute?
I'm always looking for people willing to translate this mod into other languages. If anyone wants to help with translation and get in contact with me, simply [join the discord server][1] [<img src="https://www.shareicon.net/data/128x128/2016/10/18/844052_media_512x512.png" alt="discord_logo"  width="17" />][1].  
For everything else: While this mod is essential a one-man pet project, others are welcome to assist and become contributors to Isenreik.     
I'm also always open to collaborate on projects or work together to make merge with or incorporate other mods.  Simply drop by [the discord server][1] [<img src="https://www.shareicon.net/data/128x128/2016/10/18/844052_media_512x512.png" alt="discord_logo"  width="17" />][1] or [message me on Paradoxplaza][5] [<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/629201391312105473/txI2nFBz.png" alt="paradox_logo"  width="18" />][5].  
Credit will always be given where credit is due.

## Can I modify this mod/use the code?
Well, I can't really stop anyone from doing that. It's also not really an issue, but if you genuinely take parts of this mod for yourself, give me some credit or simply message me; I don't mind helping and don't bite.
