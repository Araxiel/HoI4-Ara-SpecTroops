Araxiel's Specialised Troops mod for Paradox Interactive's Hearts of Iron 4

[Click here to open a new issue][1]

## What does this mod do?
It adds various types of new units and equipment to the game.

## When will it be finished?
Probably around the 20th of Janauary. I'm coming to the end of what I planned on doing for this mod. I might continue working on it if I got some ideas for it later on, but everything else will probably exceed the scope of this mod and I'll simply create seperate mods.

## Can others contribute?
The initial answer for that is no, this mod is a one-man project. If someone really wants to contribute, then they should message me and we can make a seperate mod or something.
