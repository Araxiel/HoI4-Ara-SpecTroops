Araxiel's Specialised Troops mod for Paradox Interactive's Hearts of Iron 4

[Click here to open a new issue][1]

## What does this mod do?
It adds various types of new units and equipment to the game.

## When will it be finished?
Probably around the 20th of Janauary. I'm coming to the end of what I planned on doing for this mod. I might continue working on it if I got some ideas for it later on, but everything else will probably exceed the scope of this mod and I'll simply create individual mods.

## Where can you download this mod?
This mod can exclusively be found on the Steam Workshop. If this mod is found anywhere else (unless specified otherwise here), it's an illegitimate and unauthorized re-upload.

## Can others contribute?
The initial answer for that is no, this mod is a one-man project. If someone really wants to contribute, then they should message me and we can make a separate mod or something.

## Can I modify this mod/use the code?
Well, I can't really stop anyone from doing that. It's also not really an issue, but if you genuinely take parts of this mod for yourself, give me some credit or simply message me; I don't mind helping and don't bite.
