Improving and sending more blankets and similar equipment will help our soldiers out. On the other hand, the jungle days and nights are both hot and humid and riddled with insects; distributing mosquito nets and insect repellent will not only stop our soldiers from constantly scratching, but also will keep many diseases at bay."
